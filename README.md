Freedom from Sound

This project is designed to help local children with autism as well as local citizens with PTSD/anxiety and anyone who would like to avoid the sometimes overbearing noise of fireworks.  Like most people, I like fireworks, but they are EVERYWHERE.  Some individuals have physical pain and/or terror from these sounds.  When neighbors do not comply with the set window of time to enjoy fireworks, it can be extremely overwhelming for some.  I am trying to find some solution for next 4th, all us "Karens" will be able to stop complaining on social media.

This site is to spread awareness of this need in the community and gain information/support to make this happen.

Thanks!

Peace and Freedom for ALL
